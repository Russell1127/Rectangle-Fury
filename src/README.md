# Custom UI for the Rectangle Assessment Project (Nuvalence) #
THis project is the UI that accompanies the project submission for the Nuvalence tech assessment. It is written in Angular and calls the Java API submitted for the project. This is an expansion on the projects bounds and is intended to show my abilities as a front-end developer for full-stack roles.

## Running the Project ##
__This application runs with Angular 13 and requires both NodeJS and Angular be installed to run locally.

- [ ] Navigate to the project's root directory in a Command or Shell prompt
- [ ] Run `ng serve` to have Angular build and run the application.


## General Use ##
The interface is simple in nature. The side-bar is used to create rectangles by either manually entering the required values or by choosing pre-loaded use case configurations from the drop-down menu. Once the rectangles are loaded the buttons located in the top-menu bar are used to validate containment, intersection, or adjacency.
